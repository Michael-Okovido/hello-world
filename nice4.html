    <h3>THE GREAT TRANSFORMER </h3>
<p>
    I heard rattling of drums from afar <br>
    Wonder welled up within me <br>
    Then like a cheetah, I dashed to the spot <br>
    A reveling crowd I saw <br>
    I glared and stared in amusement <br>
    Strand in white and maroon apparel <br>
    “What’s happening?! What’s happening?!” <br>
    I inquired from one amongst the crowd <br>
    “A Heroine! Heroine she’s being praised” <br>
    He replied <br>
    “Who is she? Where is she?” I asked further <br>
    “Here she comes, LOOK OVER THERE!!” <br>
    Someone shouted <br>
    Looking there, <br>
    A great goddess I saw <br>
    A true image of beauty <br>
    Ever willing camel, straight-laced <br>
    A statue of knowledge <br>
    A great statue filled with knowledge, vitality, wisdom and tranquility <br>
    Painted on her face was a passionate smile, <br>
    Love and care. <br>
    As brave as a lion <br>
    As kind as a mother <br>
    Words too scarce to describe her person <br>
    But here she comes, <b> MRS. OKOLIN </b> <br>
    The great transformer. <br>
    <br>
   <b> HAPPY BIRTHDAY MA </b> <br>
