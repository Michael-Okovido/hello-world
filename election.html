    <p>On the 8th of October 2021, the electoral committee of First Oxford College presented some nominees from SS3 class for various prefectship positions like the head boy position, head girl position, sanitary position etc. These positions were not awarded due to academic excellence alone instead it was based on individual capabilities.</p>
    <p>The nominees were given a period of 3 days Monday to Wednesday to carry out their campaigns. The electoral committee assisted the nominees for their campaigns by printing flyers.</p>
    <p>The election commenced on the 14th of October during the morning assembly at 7:45am. The nominees for the head boy and head girl positions were called out to give their manifestos. General election was conducted for all prefectship positions. Students were given ballot papers to cast their votes for their choice of leaders. Ballot papers from all students were placed in the ballot boxes and given to the electoral committee to collate the results.</p>
    <p>While the electoral bodies were collating the results, suspense filled the entire environment. Though students went back to their various classes for teaching and learning.</p>
    <p>Towards closing period the bell went signaling all students to gather at the assembly ground for the announcements of the results of their vote.</p>
